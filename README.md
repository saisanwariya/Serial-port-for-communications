# SCI Serial Port and 7-segment Display at PORTB

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of SCI (Serial Communication Interface) serial port I/O and the 7-segment display on a CodeWarrior HSC12 board. The program allows for interaction with a terminal connected over serial communication, offering various functionalities based on user choices. These functionalities include flashing LEDs and displaying ASCII data on PORTB through 7-segment displays.

## Setup Instructions

To run this program on a CodeWarrior HSC12 board using CodeWarrior software, follow these setup instructions:

1. **Install CodeWarrior Software:**
   - Ensure you have the CodeWarrior software installed on your computer.

2. **Connect the Hardware:**
   - Connect the CodeWarrior HSC12 board to your computer using the appropriate interface (e.g., USB).

3. **Compile and Load the Program:**
   - Open the CodeWarrior IDE.
   - Create a new project or open an existing one, and add the provided source code to the project.
   - Build and compile the project to generate the executable binary file.

4. **Load the Program onto the HSC12 Board:**
   - Use the CodeWarrior software to load the compiled binary file onto the CodeWarrior HSC12 board.

5. **Connect a Terminal Emulator:**
   - Open a terminal emulator (e.g., Hyper Terminal or PuTTY) on your computer.

6. **Configure Serial Communication:**
   - Configure the terminal emulator to use the same serial communication settings as specified in the code (e.g., baud rate, data bits, stop bits, and parity).

7. **Run the Program:**
   - Start the CodeWarrior HSC12 board.
   - You should see output on the terminal emulator corresponding to the program's menu.

8. **Interact with the Program:**
   - Follow the on-screen instructions in the terminal emulator to interact with the program and choose different functionalities.

## Program Details

- The program demonstrates various functionalities, including LED flashing and displaying ASCII data on PORTB using 7-segment displays.

- Users can input commands in the terminal emulator to trigger different actions, such as turning on and off LEDs or quitting the program.

- The program includes delay routines for timing purposes, ASCII character handling, and menu display.
